# SyndieCarp13
This is an effort in introduce a brand new map into /tg/'s SS13 map rotation.

Dubbed Project SydieCarp13, the goal of the project is to create a unique map that contains all the strengths of current maps such as metastation, boxstation, and deltastation, while providing a more unique layout to add variety to the rotation. 

WHAT IT DOES FOR THE GAME:
Boxstation, Metastation, and Deltastation control the meta in the current iteration of the game. While Pubbystation is a niche favorite, it doesn't often get picked, and Donutstation is generally avoided in polls (Donut is lucky to get chosen once in a few days). Pubby is currently the only station that is played where the map is significantly different from other options. Unfortunately, by itself, this has lead to a sort of (theres pubby and then there's everything else) mentality. By introducing another station that is different akin to Pubbystation, I hope to introcude more variety into the game.
